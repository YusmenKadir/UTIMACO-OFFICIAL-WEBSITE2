                <p class="body-text-font">Personal data within the meaning of the GDPR include all information relating to the personal or material circumstances of an identified or
                     identifiable natural person (see Art. 4(1) GDPR). Such information will regularly include not
                      only a person’s name and (e-mail) address, for example, but also the IP address and 
                     other information that could permit
                     identification of that person.
                </p>

                <p class="heading-primary-xs"> 2. Scope of Processing of Personal Data</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">We process the personal data of our users only insofar as this is required to maintain a functional website and present our content and services. We regularly process personal data of our users only with their consent. An exception may be made in cases in which it is not possible to obtain such consent for concrete reasons and the processing of the data is legally allowed.</p>
                <p class="heading-primary-xs">3. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">Art. 6(1)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides the legal basis for any request we may make for consent to process the personal data of data subjects.</p>

                <p class="body-text-font">Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR provides the legal basis for processing personal data for the performance of any contract to which a data subject is party. This will also apply to processing required prior to entering into such a contract.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR provides the legal basis for processing required to comply with any legal obligations to which our Company is subject.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">Art. 6(1)(d) GDPR provides the legal basis for processing personal data in order to protect the vital interests of a data subject or other natural person.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR provides the legal basis for processing personal data in order to safeguard the legitimate interests of our Company or any third party and the interests, fundamental rights or freedoms of a data subject do not override the interests of the former.</p>

                <p class="body-text-font">The personal data of data subjects will be erased or blocked as soon as the purpose for which they were initially stored no longer applies. Personal data may be stored for longer periods if provision for such storage has been made by European or national legislatures in Union regulations, laws or other regulatory requirements to which the controller is subject. Personal data will also be blocked or erased if a corresponding period of retention prescribed by such regulations, laws or legal requirements expires unless such data are required for the entry into or performance of a contract.</p>

                <p class="body-text-font">Our system automatically records data and information from the computer system of every visitor to our Internet site.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">This involves recording the following data:</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(1) Date and time of access</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(2) Browser type, version and language</p>

                <p class="body-text-font">These data are stored in the log files of our system. We store IP addresses only in pseudonymized form. This is done by using a standard procedure that involves replacing the final three digits of the IP addresses stored in the log files by three digits selected at random. This makes it impossible to identify data subjects.</p>

                <p class="heading-primary-xs">2. Legal Basis for Processing of Data</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR provides the legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files.</p>

                <p class="heading-primary-xs">3. Purpose of Processing Data</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">Temporary storage of IP addresses by the system is required to deliver the website to the computer of the user. As a result, the IP addresses of users must be stored for the duration of the respective session.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">The purpose of storage in log files is to ensure the functionality of the website and support technical administration of the network infrastructure. In addition, such data enable us to enhance our website and maintain the security of our information technology systems. We also use these data to prepare and evaluate internal statistics. This involves no evaluation of data for marketing purposes.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">We have a legitimate interest in processing data for such purposes pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.</p>


                <p class="heading-primary-xs">4. Duration of Storage</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">Data are erased as soon as they are no longer needed to achieve the purposes for which they were initially collected. In the case of data collected to permit delivery of our website, this occurs when the respective session is ended.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">In the case of data stored in log files, this will regularly take place within seven days. Storage for a longer period is possible. In such cases, data are pseudonymized so that they no longer permit identification of a specific user. Backups are kept in encrypted form for 14 days.</p>
                

                <p class="heading-primary-xs">5. Possibility of Objection and Elimination</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">It is absolutely necessary to collect and store data in log files to permit delivery of the website. As a result, users may not object to such storage.</p>

                <p class="body-text-font">This cookie is set to identify visitors but does not contain any personal information and is created on the basis of a random routine. In order for Google Analytics to be able to determine whether two visits were made by the same user, a unique identifier must be sent with each visit that can be used to permit recognition of the individual user. The analytics.js library does this by using a ‘Client ID’, which is a unique, randomly generated string of numbers that is stored on the user’s computer by the user’s web browser so that subsequent visits to a website by the same user can be associated with that user. Analytics.js uses a single standard first-party cookie called _ga to store Client IDs.</p>

The data will be used exclusively for the purposes of processing and responding to the user’s message.</p>
                
                <p class="heading-primary-xs">2. Legal Basis for Processing of Data</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR provides the legal basis for processing the data transmitted in connection with an e-mail. If the contact takes place in connection with the performance of a contract, Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR provides a further legal basis for processing.</p>
                <p class="heading-primary-xs">3. Purpose of Processing Data</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">The processing of personal data within the framework of establishing contact serves us solely for processing the contact. This is also our legitimate interest in processing the personal data.</p>

                <p class="body-text-font">Other personal data from the input mask processed during the transmission process serve to prevent abusive use of the contact form and maintain the security of our information technology systems.</p>

                <p class="heading-primary-xs">4. Duration of Storage</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">Data are erased as soon as they are no longer needed to achieve the purposes for which they were initially collected. In the case of personal data from the input mask of the contact request form and the data transmitted with the e-mail, this occurs when the respective conversation with the user is terminated. A conversation is considered to be terminated when circumstances make it possible to assume that the respective issue has been conclusively clarified.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">Other personal data that are also collected during the delivery process will regularly be erased within eight days.</p>
                

                <p class="heading-primary-xs">5. Possibility of Objection and Elimination</p>

                <p class="body-text-font">The user has the right to object to the processing of personal data at any time. In such a case, the conversation cannot be continued. The objection can be explained to us by sending an e-mail to info@utimaco.com.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">All personal data stored in connection with contact requests will be erased in this case.</p>

                <h1 class="heading-primary-smaller">VIII. Rights of Data Subjects</h1>
                <p class="body-text-font">If your personal data are processed, that makes you a data subject within the meaning of the GDPR and you have the following rights, which the controller must respect:</p>


                <p class="heading-primary-xs">1. Rights of Access</p>

                <p class="body-text-font">You have the right to request that the controller confirm whether personal data that relate to you are processed by us.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">If that should be the case, you can request information on the following from the controller:</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(1) the purposes for which the personal data are processed;</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(2) the categories of personal data processed;</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(3) the recipients or categories of recipients to whom your personal data are or have been disclosed;</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(4) the contemplated duration of storage of your personal data or, if concrete information cannot be provided, the criteria for determination of the duration of storage;</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(5) the existence of a right to rectification or erasure of your personal data, a right to restriction of processing by the controller or a right to object to such processing;</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(6) the existence of a right to lodge complaints with a supervisory authority;</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(7) all available information on the origin of personal data not obtained from the data subject;</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(8) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, pursuant to Art. 22(1) and (4) GDPR and – at least in these cases – meaningful information on the logic involved and the scope and intended effects of such processing for the data subject.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">You have the right to receive information on whether your personal data are transferred to a third country or an international organization. In this context, you can require that we notify you of appropriate safeguards pursuant to Art. 46 GDPR in connection with any such transfer.</p>

                <p class="heading-primary-xs">2. Right to Rectification</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">You have the right to require that the controller rectify and/or complete your personal data if the data that are processed are inaccurate or incomplete. The controller must make such changes without undue delay.</p>


                <p class="heading-primary-xs">3. Right to Restrict Processing</p>

                <p class="body-text-font">You have the right to require that the controller restrict processing of your personal data under the following conditions:</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(1) if you contest the accuracy of personal data for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the respective personal data;</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(2) if the processing is unlawful and you oppose erasure of the personal data and request restriction of their use instead;</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(3) if the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of processing, but you need the personal data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; and</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(4) if you have objected to processing pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR pending verification of whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override your grounds.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">If the processing of your personal data has been restricted, such personal data may, except as regards storage, be processed only with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the Union or of a Member State.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">If processing has been restricted as described above, you will be notified by the controller before such restriction is lifted.</p>
                

                <p class="heading-primary-xs">4. Right to Erasure</p>
                <p class="heading-primary-xs">a) Duty to erase</p>

                <p class="body-text-font">You have the right to require that the controller erase personal data concerning you without undue delay and the controller must then erase such personal data without undue delay if one of the following grounds applies:</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(1) The personal data are no longer needed for the purposes for which they were originally collected or otherwise processed;</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(2) You have withdrawn the consent to processing given pursuant to of Art. 6(1)(a) or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR and there is no other legal ground for such processing;</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(3) You object to the processing pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for such processing or you object to the processing pursuant to Art. 21(2) GDPR;</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(4) Your personal data were processed unlawfully;</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(5) Your personal data must be erased to comply with a legal obligation under Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject;</p>
                

                <p class="body-text-font">(6) Your personal data were collected in connection with an offer of information society services pursuant to Art. 8(1) GDPR;</p>
                


                <p class="heading-primary-xs">b) Information Provided to Third Parties</p>

                <p class="body-text-font">If the controller has disclosed personal data concerning you and is obligated to erase such data pursuant to Art. 17(1) GDPR, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, must take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers that are processing the personal data that you, as the data subject, have requested erasure by such controllers of any links to or copy or replication of such personal data.</p>



                <p class="heading-primary-xs">c) Exceptions</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">The right to erasure does not apply if processing is necessary</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(1) to exercise the right to freedom of expression and information;</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(2) to comply with a legal obligation that requires processing under Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or to exercise official authority vested in the controller;</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(3) for reasons of public interest in the area of the public health pursuant to Art. 9(2)(h) and (i) and Art. 9(3) GDPR;</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(4) for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Art. 89(1) GDPR insofar as the right referred to in section a) is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of such processing; or</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(5) to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</p>


                <p class="heading-primary-xs">5. Right to Rectification</p>

                <p class="body-text-font">If you have the right to require that a controller rectify, erase or restrict processing, the controller must notify all recipients to whom personal data concerning you were disclosed of such rectification, erasure or restriction of processing unless notification proves impossible or would entail an unreasonable effort.

                    You have the right to be notified of such recipients by the controller.
                </p>

                <p class="heading-primary-xs">6. Right to data portability</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">You have right to receive the personal data concerning you that you have made available to a controller in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to transmit such data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data were provided</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(1) if processing is based on consent pursuant to Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR and</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(2) processing is carried out by automated means.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">In exercising this right, you also have the right to have personal data concerning you transmitted directly from one controller to another if technically feasible. This may not be allowed to adversely affect the freedoms and rights of others.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">The right to data portability does not apply to the processing of personal data required for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.</p>



                <p class="heading-primary-xs">7. Right to object</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">You have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for reasons related to your particular situation on the basis of Art. 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR. This will also apply accordingly as regards profiling based on these provisions.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">The controller will then cease to process personal data concerning you unless it is possible to demonstrate compelling legitimate reasons for such processing that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms or such processing serves to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">If personal data concerning you are processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object to the processing of your data for such marketing purposes at any time. This will apply accordingly to any profiling related to such direct marketing activities.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">If you object to processing for the purposes of direct marketing, personal data concerning you will no longer be processed for such purposes.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">In the context of the use of information society services and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, you may exercise your right to object by automated means using technical specifications.</p>

                <p class="heading-primary-xs">8. Right to Withdraw Consent under Data Protection Law</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">You have right to withdraw your consent to having your personal data processed at any time. Withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your consent prior to withdrawal.</p>


                <p class="heading-primary-xs">9. Automated Individual Decision-Making, Including Profiling</p>

                <p class="body-text-font">You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that legally affects you or entails effects that are of similar importance. This will not apply in the case of any decision that is</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(1) necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract between you and the controller,</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(2) permissible under Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests or</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">(3) based on your explicit consent.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">However, these decisions may not be based on special categories of personal data pursuant to Art. 9(1) GDPR unless Art. 9(2)(a) or (g) GDPR applies and suitable measures have been taken to safeguard your rights and freedoms as well as your legitimate interests.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">In the cases referred to in (1) and (3) above, the controller must implement suitable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms as well as your legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express your point of view and to contest the decision.</p>

                <p class="heading-primary-xs">10. Right to Lodge Complaints with a Supervisory Authority</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement if you are of the opinion that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes the GDPR.</p>
                <p class="body-text-font">The supervisory authority with which the complaint is lodged will inform the complainant on the progress and the outcome of the complaint including the possibility of a judicial remedy pursuant to Art. 78 GDPR.</p>
